## Brief

The brief provided to us for this project sets the following out as its overall objective: "create an application that generates “Objects” upon a set of predefined rules. These “Objects” can be from whatever domain you wish."

I propose to create...


We must create an application that has at least 4 services working together.
Service 1 will be the 'core service' which will be responsible for communicating with the other 3 services. Services 2 and 3 will both create a random object, with service 4 also creating a random object based on the results of services 2 and 3.
